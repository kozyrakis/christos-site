 abstract = {Code size and energy consumption are critical design concerns for embedded processors as they determine the cost of the overall system. Techniques such as reduced length instruction sets lead to significant code size savings but also introduce performance and energy consumption impediments such as additional dynamic instructions or decompression latency. In this paper, we show that a block-aware instruction set (BLISS) which stores basic block descriptors in addition to and separately from the actual instructions in the program allows embedded processors to achieve significant improvements in all three metrics: reduced code size and improved performance and lower energy consumption.},
