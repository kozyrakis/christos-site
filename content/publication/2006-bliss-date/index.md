abstract: 'Code size and energy consumption are critical design concerns for embedded
  processors as they determine the cost of the overall system. Techniques such as
  reduced length instruction sets lead to significant code size savings but also introduce
  performance and energy consumption impediments such as additional dynamic instructions
  or decompression latency. In this paper, we show that a block-aware instruction
  set (BLISS) which stores basic block descriptors in addition to and separately from
  the actual instructions in the program allows embedded processors to achieve significant
  improvements in all three metrics: reduced code size and improved performance and
  lower energy consumption.'
