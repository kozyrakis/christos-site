abstract: Plasticine is a new spatially reconfigurable architecture designed to efficiently
  execute applications composed of high-level parallel patterns. With an area footprint
  of 113 mm2 in a 28-nm process and a 1-GHz clock, Plasticine has a peak floating-point
  performance of 12.3 single-precision Tflops and a total on-chip memory capacity
  of 16 MB, consuming a maximum power of 49 W. Plasticine provides an improvement
  of up to 76.9X in performance-per-watt over a conventional FPGA over a wide range
  of dense and sparse applications.
