abstract: Multicore architectures are an inflection point in mainstream software development
  because they force developers to write parallel programs. In a previous article
  in Queue, Herb Sutter and James Larus pointed out, “The concurrency revolution is
  primarily a software revolution. The difficult problem is not building multicore
  hardware, but programming it in a way that lets mainstream applications benefit
  from the continued exponential growth in CPU performance.” In this new multicore
  world, developers must write explicitly parallel applications that can take advantage
  of the increasing number of cores that each successive multicore generation will
  provide.
