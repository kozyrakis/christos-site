abstract: The rapid growth of online services in the last decade has led to the development
  of large data centers to host these workloads. These large-scale online, user-facing
  services have unique engineering and capacity provisioning design requirements.
  The authors explore these requirements, focusing on system balancing, the impact
  of technology trends, and the challenges of online service workloads.
