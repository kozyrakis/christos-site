abstract: The front-end in superscalar processors must deliver high application performance
  in an energy-effective manner. Impediments such as multi-cycle instruction accesses,
  instruction-cache misses, and mispredictions reduce performance by 48% and increase
  energy consumption by 21%. This paper presents a block-aware instruction set architecture
  (BLISS) that defines basic block descriptors in addition to the actual instructions
  in a program. BLISS allows for a decoupled front-end that reduces the time and energy
  spent on misspeculated instructions. It also allows for accurate instruction prefetching
  and energy efficient instruction access. A BLISS-based front-end leads to 14% IPC,
  16% total energy, and 83% energy-delay-squared product improvements for wide-issue
  processors
