abstract: The RAMP project's goal is to enable the intensive, multidisciplinary innovation
  that the computing industry will need to tackle the problems of parallel processing.
  RAMP itself is an open-source, community-developed, FPGA-based emulator of parallel
  architectures. Its design framework lets a large, collaborative community develop
  and contribute reusable, composable design modules. Three complete designs--for
  transactional memory, distributed systems, and distributed-shared memory--demonstrate
  the platform's potential.
