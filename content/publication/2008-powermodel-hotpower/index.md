abstract: Dynamic power management in enterprise environments requires an understanding
  of the relationship between resource utilization and system-level power consumption.
  Power models based on resource utilization have been proposed in the context of
  enabling specific energy-efficiency optimizations on specific machines, but the
  accuracy and portability of different approaches to modeling have not been systematically
  compared. In this work, we use a common infrastructure to fit a family of high-level
  full-system power models, and we compare these models over a wide variation of workloads
  and machines, from a laptop to a server. This analysis shows that a model based
  on OS utilization metrics and CPU performance counters is generally most accurate
  across the machines and workloads tested. It is particularly useful for machines
  whose dynamic power consumption is not dominated by the CPU, as well as machines
  with aggressively power-managed CPUs, two classes of systems that are increasingly
  prevalent.
