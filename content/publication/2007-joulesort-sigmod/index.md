abstract: The energy efficiency of computer systems is an important concern in a variety
  of contexts. In data centers, reducing energy use improves operating cost, scalability,
  reliability, and other factors. For mobile devices, energy consumption directly
  affects functionality and usability. We propose and motivate JouleSort, an external
  sort benchmark, for evaluating the energy efficiency of a wide range of computer
  systems from clusters to handhelds. We list the criteria, challenges, and pitfalls
  from our experience in creating a fair energy-efficiency benchmark. Using a commercial
  sort, we demonstrate a JouleSort system that is over 3.5x as energy-efficient as
  last year's estimated winner. This system is quite different from those currently
  used in data centers. It consists of a commodity mobile CPU and 13 laptop drives
  connected by server-style I/O interfaces.
