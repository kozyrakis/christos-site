 abstract = {The Vantage cache-partitioning technique enables configurability and quality-of-service guarantees in large-scale chip multiprocessors with shared caches. Caches can have hundreds of partitions with sizes specified at cache line granularity, while maintaining high associativity and strict isolation among partitions},
