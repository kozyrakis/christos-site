abstract: The Vantage cache-partitioning technique enables configurability and quality-of-service
  guarantees in large-scale chip multiprocessors with shared caches. Caches can have
  hundreds of partitions with sizes specified at cache line granularity, while maintaining
  high associativity and strict isolation among partitions
