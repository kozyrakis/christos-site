 abstract = {Recent research in high-throughput networked systems has established the need for centralized and preemptive request scheduling in order to achieve good hardware utilization and low tail latency for a wide variety of workloads. However, this approach is expensive to scale as it requires an increasing number of CPU cores dedicated to scheduling. Moreover, passing every request through a scheduling core introduces latency for inter-core communication and reduces the effectiveness of data preloading and caching optimizations.In this paper, we advocate in favor of pushing request-to-core scheduling back into the NIC. Instead of the simple request distribution of receive-side-scaling (RSS) in current NICs, we suggest implementing preemptive request scheduling by passing to the NIC up-to-date information about core availability and execution status of active requests. We present a prototype implementation on a commercial Smart-NIC that indeed shows performance benefits for different workload scenarios. The prototype allows us to also observe bottlenecks that largely come from artifacts of existing NIC hardware. We propose research towards addressing these limitations in order to achieve low overhead, low latency, and highly efficient request scheduling.},
