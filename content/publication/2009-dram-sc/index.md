abstract: Continuous evolution in process technology brings energy-efficiency and
  reliability challenges, which are harder for memory system designs since chip multiprocessors
  demand high bandwidth and capacity, global wires improve slowly, and more cells
  are susceptible to hard and soft errors. Recently, there are proposals aiming at
  better main-memory energy efficiency by dividing a memory rank into subsets.We holistically
  assess the effectiveness of rank subsetting in the context of system-wide performance,
  energy-efficiency, and reliability perspectives. We identify the impact of rank
  subsetting on memory power and processor performance analytically, then verify the
  analyses by simulating a chipmultiprocessor system using multithreaded and consolidated
  workloads. We extend the design of Multicore DIMM, one proposal embodying rank subsetting,
  for high-reliability systems and show that compared with conventional chipkill approaches,
  it can lead to much higher system-level energy efficiency and performance at the
  cost of additional DRAM devices.
