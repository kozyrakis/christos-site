abstract: It is time to reconsider unifying logic and memory. Since most of the transistors
  on this merged chip will be devoted to memory, it is called 'intelligent RAM'. IRAM
  is attractive because the gigabit DRAM chip has enough transistors for both a powerful
  processor and a memory big enough to contain whole programs and data sets. It contains
  1024 memory blocks each 1kb wide. It needs more metal layers to accelerate the long
  lines of 600mm/sup 2/ chips. It may require faster transistors for the high-speed
  interface of synchronous DRAM. Potential advantages of IRAM include lower memory
  latency, higher memory bandwidth, lower system power, adjustable memory width and
  size, and less board space. Challenges for IRAM include high chip yield given processors
  have not been repairable via redundancy, high memory retention rates given processors
  usually need higher power than DRAMs, and a fast processor given logic is slower
  in a DRAM process.
