 abstract = {Among the various switch buffer architectures, output queueing implemented in a completely shared buffer is the one that achieves the highest possible utilization of both output
bandwidth and buffer space. The high link throughput, small cell size and additional features of ATM switching, such as multiple classes of service, multicasting and flow control,
enforce further extensions to the above scheme and demand pure hardware implementations. In this work we present the hardware block maintaining output queues per priority
class in the ATLAS I single chip ATM switch. It also provides support for multicasting
and multi-lane credit-based flow control. Techniques such as pipelined and superscalar
processing, usually employed in processorsâ€™ design, are used in order to accommodate for
the amount and high speed of operation required. This also modifies the approach to the
timing of operations, the control design and the calculation of the hardware complexity.
The block was extensively simulated to ensure the correctness of its operation. Although
the hardware implementation is currently in progress, the circuits already laid out are presented, while the VLSI design of the remaining blocks is analyzed. In addition, the Priority
Enforcer circuit and its full-custom layout is thoroughly described.},
