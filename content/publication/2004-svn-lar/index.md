abstract: "The stream computing paradigm separates the application's computational\
  \ kernels from communication streams, matching the structure and performance constraints\
  \ of modern multiprocessors and data intensive applications with regular communication\
  \ patterns. The multitude of stream architectures and languages create interoperability\
  \ problems and cause duplication of compiler and tool development efforts. To address\
  \ this, the Morphware Forum [8] is developing a two-level complication process,\
  \ whereby a language-specific high-level compiler interfaces with an architecture-specific\
  \ low-level compiler using an architecture model and Streaming Virtual Machine [7]\
  \ code. We describe this interface and highlight the challenges of this approach. "
