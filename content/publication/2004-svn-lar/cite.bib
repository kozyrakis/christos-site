 abstract = {The stream computing paradigm separates the application's
computational kernels from communication streams, matching the
structure and performance constraints of modern multiprocessors
and data intensive applications with regular communication
patterns. The multitude of stream architectures and languages
create interoperability problems and cause duplication of compiler
and tool development efforts. To address this, the Morphware
Forum [8] is developing a two-level complication process,
whereby a language-specific high-level compiler interfaces with
an architecture-specific low-level compiler using an architecture
model and Streaming Virtual Machine [7] code. We describe this
interface and highlight the challenges of this approach. },
