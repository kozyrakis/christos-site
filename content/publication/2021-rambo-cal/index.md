abstract: Microservices are becoming the defining paradigm of cloud applications,
  which raises urgent challenges for efficient datacenter management. Guaranteeing
  end-to-end Service Level Agreement (SLA) while optimizing resource allocation is
  critical to both cloud service providers and users. However, one application may
  contain hundreds of microservices, which constitute an enormous search space that
  is unfeasible to explore exhaustively. Thus, we propose RAMBO, an SLA-aware framework
  for microservices that leverages multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (BO) to allocate
  resources and meet performance/cost goals. Experiments conducted on a real microservice
  workload demonstrate that RAMBO can correctly characterize each microservice and
  efficiently discover Pareto-optimal solutions. We envision that the proposed methodology
  and results will benefit future resource planning, cluster orchestration, and job
  scheduling.
