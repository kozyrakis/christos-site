 abstract = {There are a significant number of Transactional Memory(TM) proposals, varying in almost all aspects of the design space. Although several transactional benchmarks have been suggested, a simple, yet thorough, evaluation framework is still needed to completely characterize a TM system and allow for comparison among the various proposals. Unfortunately, TM system evaluation is difficult because the application characteristics which affect performance are often difficult to isolate from each other. We propose a set of orthogonal application characteristics that form a basis for transactional behavior and are useful in fully understanding the performance of a TM system. In this paper, we present EigenBench, a lightweight yet powerful microbenchmark for fully evaluating a transactional memory system. We show that EigenBench is useful for thoroughly exploring the orthogonal space of TM application characteristics. Because of its flexibility, our microbenchmark is also capable of reproducing a representative set of TM performance pathologies. In this paper, we use Eigenbench to evaluate two well-known TM systems and provide significant insight about their strengths and weaknesses. We also demonstrate how EigenBench can be used to mimic the evaluation coverage of a popular TM benchmark suite called STAM.},
