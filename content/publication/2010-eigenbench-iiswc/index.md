abstract: There are a significant number of Transactional Memory(TM) proposals, varying
  in almost all aspects of the design space. Although several transactional benchmarks
  have been suggested, a simple, yet thorough, evaluation framework is still needed
  to completely characterize a TM system and allow for comparison among the various
  proposals. Unfortunately, TM system evaluation is difficult because the application
  characteristics which affect performance are often difficult to isolate from each
  other. We propose a set of orthogonal application characteristics that form a basis
  for transactional behavior and are useful in fully understanding the performance
  of a TM system. In this paper, we present EigenBench, a lightweight yet powerful
  microbenchmark for fully evaluating a transactional memory system. We show that
  EigenBench is useful for thoroughly exploring the orthogonal space of TM application
  characteristics. Because of its flexibility, our microbenchmark is also capable
  of reproducing a representative set of TM performance pathologies. In this paper,
  we use Eigenbench to evaluate two well-known TM systems and provide significant
  insight about their strengths and weaknesses. We also demonstrate how EigenBench
  can be used to mimic the evaluation coverage of a popular TM benchmark suite called
  STAM.
