abstract: The DRAM-Based Reconfigurable Acceleration Fabric (DRAF) uses commodity
  DRAM technology to implement a bit-level, reconfigurable fabric that improves area
  density by 10 times and power consumption by more than 3 times over conventional
  field-programmable gate arrays. Latency overlapping and multicontext support allow
  DRAF to meet the performance and density requirements of demanding applications
  in datacenter and mobile environments.
