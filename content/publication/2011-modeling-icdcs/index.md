abstract: Data center workload modeling has become a necessity in recent years due
  to the emergence of large-scale applications and cloud data-stores, whose implementation
  remains largely unknown. Detailed knowledge of target workloads is critical in order
  to correctly provision performance, power and cost-optimized systems. In this work
  we aggregate previous work on data center workload modeling and perform a qualitative
  comparison based on the representativeness, accuracy and completeness of these designs.
  We categorize modeling techniques in two main approaches, in-breadth and in-depth,
  based on the way they address the modeling of the workload. The former models the
  behavior of a workload in specific system parts, while the latter traces a user
  request throughout its execution. Furthermore, we propose the early concept of a
  new design, which bridges the gap between these two approaches by combining some
  features from each one. Some first results on the request features and performance
  metrics of the generated workload based on this design appear promising as far as
  the accuracy of the model is concerned.
