abstract: 'In the past few years, two important trends have evolved that could change
  the shape of computing: multimedia applications and portable electronics. Together,
  these trends will lead to a personal mobile-computing environment, a small device
  carried all the time that incorporates the functions of the pager, cellular phone,
  laptop computer, PDA, digital camera, and video game. The microprocessor needed
  for these devices is actually a merged general-purpose processor and digital-signal
  processor, with the power budget of the latter. Yet for almost two decades, architecture
  research has focused on desktop or server machines. We are designing processors
  of the future with a heavy bias toward the past. To design successful processor
  architectures for the future, we first need to explore future applications and match
  their requirements in a scalable, cost-effective way. The authors describe Vector
  IRAM, an initial approach in this direction, and challenge others in the very successful
  computer architecture community to investigate architectures with a heavy bias for
  the future.'
