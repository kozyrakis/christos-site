abstract: User-facing, latency-sensitive services, such as websearch, underutilize
  their computing resources during daily periods of low traffic. Reusing those resources
  for other tasks is rarely done in production services since the contention for shared
  resources can cause latency spikes that violate the service-level objectives of
  latency-sensitive tasks. The resulting under-utilization hurts both the affordability
  and energy efficiency of large-scale datacenters. With the slowdown in technology
  scaling caused by the sunsetting of Mooreâ€™s law, it becomes important to address
  this opportunity.We present Heracles, a feedback-based controller that enables the
  safe colocation of best-effort tasks alongside a latency-critical service. Heracles
  dynamically manages multiple hardware and software isolation mechanisms, such as
  CPU, memory, and network isolation, to ensure that the latency-sensitive job meets
  latency targets while maximizing the resources given to best-effort tasks. We evaluate
  Heracles using production latency-critical and batch workloads from Google and demonstrate
  average server utilizations of 90% without latency violations across all the load
  and colocation scenarios that we evaluated.
