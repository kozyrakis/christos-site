abstract: To increase datacenter energy efficiency, we need memory systems that keep
  pace with processor efficiency gains. Currently, servers use DDR3 memory, which
  is designed for high bandwidth but not for energy proportionality. A system using
  20% of the peak DDR3 bandwidth consumes 2.3x the energy per bit compared to the
  energy consumed by a system with fully utilized memory bandwidth. Nevertheless,
  many datacenter applications stress memory capacity and latency but not memory bandwidth.
  In response, we architect server memory systems using mobile DRAM devices, trading
  peak bandwidth for lower energy consumption per bit and more efficient idle modes.
  We demonstrate 3-5x lower memory power, better proportionality, and negligible performance
  penalties for datacenter workloads.
