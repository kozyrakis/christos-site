abstract: The world's appetite for abundant-data computing, where a massive amount
  of structured and unstructured data is analyzed, has increased dramatically. The
  computational demands of these applications, such as deep learning, far exceed the
  capabilities of today's systems, especially for energy-constrained embedded systems
  (e.g., mobile systems with limited battery capacity). These demands are unlikely
  to be met by isolated improvements in transistor or memory technologies, or integrated
  circuit (IC) architectures alone. Transformative nanosystems, which leverage the
  unique properties of emerging nanotechnologies to create new IC architectures, are
  required to deliver unprecedented functionality, performance, and energy efficiency.
  We show that the projected energy efficiency benefits of domain-specific 3D nanosystems
  is in the range of 1,000x (quantified using the product of system-level energy consumption
  and execution time) over today's domain-specific 2D systems with off-chip DRAM.
  Such a drastic improvement is key to enabling new capabilities such as deep learning
  in embedded systems.
