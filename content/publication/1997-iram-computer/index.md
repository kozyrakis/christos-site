abstract: Members of the University of California, Berkeley, argue that the memory
  system will be the greatest inhibitor of performance gains in future architectures.
  Thus, they propose the intelligent RAM or IRAM. This approach greatly increases
  the on-chip memory capacity by using DRAM technology instead of much less dense
  SRAM memory cells. The resultant on-chip memory capacity coupled with the high bandwidths
  available on chip should allow cost-effective vector processors to reach performance
  levels much higher than those of traditional architectures. Although vector processors
  require explicit compilation, the authors claim that vector compilation technology
  is mature (having been used for decades in supercomputers), and furthermore, that
  future workloads will contain more heavily vectorizable components.
