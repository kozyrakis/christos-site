abstract: Next-generation information technologies will process unprecedented amounts
  of loosely structured data that overwhelm existing computing systems. N3XT improves
  the energy efficiency of abundant-data applications 1,000-fold by using new logic
  and memory technologies, 3D integration with fine-grained connectivity, and new
  architectures for computation immersed in memory.
