abstract: Power consumption and energy efficiency are important factors in the initial
  design and day-to-day management of computer systems. Researchers and system designers
  need benchmarks that characterize energy efficiency to evaluate systems and identify
  promising new technologies. To predict the effects of new designs and configurations,
  they also need accurate methods of modeling power consumption.
