abstract: We investigate autonomic power control policies for Internet servers and
  data centers. In particular, by monitoring the system load and thermal status, we
  decide how to vary the utilized processing resources to achieve acceptable delay
  and power performance. We formulate the problem using a dynamic programming approach
  that captures the power-performance tradeoff. We study the structural properties
  of the optimal solution and develop low-complexity justified heuristics, which achieve
  significant performance gains over standard benchmarks. The performance gains are
  higher when the load exhibits stronger temporal variations. We also demonstrate
  that the heuristics are very efficient, in the sense that they perform very close
  to the optimal solution obtained via dynamic programming.
