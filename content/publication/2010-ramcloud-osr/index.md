abstract: 'Disk-oriented approaches to online storage are becoming increasingly problematic:
  they do not scale gracefully to meet the needs of large-scale Web applications,
  and improvements in disk capacity have far outstripped improvements in access latency
  and bandwidth. This paper argues for a new approach to datacenter storage called
  RAMCloud, where information is kept entirely in DRAM and large-scale systems are
  created by aggregating the main memories of thousands of commodity servers. We believe
  that RAMClouds can provide durable and available storage with 100-1000x the throughput
  of disk-based systems and 100-1000x lower access latency. The combination of low
  latency and large scale will enable a new breed of dataintensive applications.'
